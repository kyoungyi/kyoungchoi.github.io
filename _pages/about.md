# Welcome to Kyoung's Homepage!

👩‍💻 With diverse experience in both private and public sectors, I’m advancing my interdisciplinary background by pursuing a PhD in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University.

🔍 My research focuses on the intersection of physical climate and scoio-economic sciences. I am particularly interested in **improving the systematic assessment of climate risk for agricultural systems** and **identifying adaptation gaps, using statistical models (e.g., econometric and machine learning approaches)**.

📖 My current projects involve **assessing climate risks for US crop and milk yields** by quantifying spatio-temporal variations in physical climate hazards, exposure to the hazards, and relative vulnerability.

Agricultural production is heavily influenced by weather conditions and socioeconomic factors. Understanding  the “Hazard + Exposure + Vulnerability” framework in agricultural systems is crucial for accurately estimating the impacts of climate change on agricultural production and enhancing resilience via effective adaptation actions.

## 🌦️ Hazards:
### 🌾 Impact of drought and waterlogging on crop yields:
Hydroclimatic stresses, such as droughts and flooding, have significantly impacted US crop yields, accounting for more than 50% of the federal insurance payouts for crop yield loss since 1989. [In this study] (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0c87#:~:text=Hydroclimatic%20stresses%20can%20negatively%20impact,scales%20is%20not%20well%20understood.), I identified crop-specific yield sensitivities to soil water supply-atmospheric water demand, estimating historical spatial-temporal patterns of yield losses.

### 🐮 Impact of heat and cold stress on milk yields:
Heat stress is a major factor in reducing milk yields, causing approximately $2 billion in economic losses. While the impact of heat stress is well-documented at the physiological level using animal-level heat stress indices, its application at national and subnational scales remains uncertain. [To address this gap] (https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(24)00733-1/fulltext), I systematically compared the performance of four commonly used thermal indices in quantifying milk yield changes due to thermal stress at national scales. The study provides important insights into the applicability of animal-based thermal indices and the limitations of using fixed thresholds for large-scale milk yield assessment.

Currently, I’m developing a new thermal stress index using explainable machine learning.

## ⛰️ Exposure:
Climate variability and change drive the impacts of physical climate hazards on agricultural production, but exposure to these hazards can alter the final yield loss risk by agricultural operators via changing their land locations. Here, I’m exploring how geographical changes in cropland can modify yield loss over time and space.

## 👩‍🌾 Vulnerability:
Adaptive capacities, such as in-situ adaptation strategies or socio-economic background of agricultural operators, can adjust the consequences of yield loss from climate hazards and exposure. This study assesses the impact of agricultural socio-economic factors on crop yield losses identified by the aforementioned hazard and exposure.
