ðŸ•µ Hi there, my name is Eunkyoung Choi (I go by Kyoung).
I come from Busan, S.Korea, a beautiful ocean city (see the below photos). In 2018, I moved to the US for my life exploration and goals - to become a climate risk scientist who helps the interface of physical and social sciences by understanding both fields.

I am currently in the PhD program of the Ecosystem Science and Sustainability department at Colorado State University (CSU), working with Dr. Nathan Mueller (amazing advisor ðŸ™‚). My dissertation centers on the assessment of climate risks in  agricultural production (see the main page). Prior to my PhD journey at Colorado, I did my masters in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I also worked in environmental consulting for about 4 years across S.Korea and Japan.

Having grown up in S. Korea and expanded my horizons in both the private and public sectors worldwide, I have always been driven by a quest for knowledge and self-improvement. I am constantly discovering myself, nurturing my dreams, and shaping my perspectives ðŸŒŽ.
