excerpt: ' 
ðŸ•µ Hi there, my name is Eunkyoung Choi (Kyoung). <br>
I come from Busan, S. Korea, a beautiful ocean city known for its dynamic blend of urban and natural beauty (see the photos below). <br>
<br>
In 2018, I decided to move to the US. This move was fueled by more than just wanderlust; it was a quest for learning/understanding science (not just through media), nurturing my knowledge, empowering people (particularly communities in need) with my learnings, and contributing to the Earth ðŸŒŽ.<br>
<br>
Now, I am at Colorado State University pursuing a PhD in climate risk assessment for agricultural production. <br>
I am deepening my grasp of scientific principles, constantly discovering myself, nurturing my dreams, and shaping my perspectives. <br> 
<br>
Please feel free to connect with me if you have any questions (e.g., science, women in science, international students, etc.)!
